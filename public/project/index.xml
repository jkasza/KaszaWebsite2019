      <description>I have developed statistical methods for the investigation of healthcare provider performance, and investigated the performance of intensive care units, dialysis centres, and have critiqued the comparison of anaesthetists.

      <description>My work in multiple-period cluster randomised trials has been focussed on increasing our understanding of the statistical aspects of these designs, and the development of more realistic within-cluster correlation structures.

      <description>Preventing sexual and other forms of harassment within the statistical community is something I have been working on over the last year or so. I instigated the formation of and chaired the Statistical Society of Australia&amp;rsquo;s Committee for preventing and responding to sexual harassment. I led the development of a Code of Conduct for ISCB ASC 2018 (available here), and have written about the things the Code of Conduct Response team got right, and what could have been improved, available here.</description>
