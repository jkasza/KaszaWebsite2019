My work in longitudinal cluster randomised trials has been focussed on increasing our understanding of the statistical aspects of these designs, and the development of more realistic within-cluster correlation structures. I am part of an International Network on Innovative Cluster Randomised Trials: more information available [here](https://clustertrials-research.netlify.com/). Please get in touch if you would like copies of any of these papers.
