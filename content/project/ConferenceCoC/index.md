Preventing sexual and other forms of harassment within the statistical community is something I have been working on over the last year or so. I instigated the formation of and chaired the Statistical Society of Australia's Committee for preventing and responding to sexual harassment. I led the development of a Code of Conduct for ISCB ASC 2018 (available [here](https://iscbasc2018.com/code-of-conduct/)), and have written about the things the Code of Conduct Response team got right, and what could have been improved, available [here](/pdf/ISCBASC2018_CoCReport_website.pdf).
