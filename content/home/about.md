# About me

I'm a biostatistician in the Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine at Monash University, in Melbourne, Australia, and I'm part of [ViCBiostat](http://www.vicbiostat.org.au/): the Victorian Centre for Biostatistics. I'm the President of the [Statistical Society of Australia](http://www.statsoc.org.au/), and am dedicated to ensuring that the statistical community in Australia is welcoming, respectful and inclusive. 

My colleagues and I recently wrote about the importance of fostering biostatistics research for the success of research in health and medicine.
