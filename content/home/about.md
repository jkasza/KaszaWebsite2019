# About me

I'm a biostatistician in the Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine at Monash University, in Melbourne, Australia, and I'm part of [ViCBiostat](http://www.vicbiostat.org.au/): the Victorian Centre for Biostatistics, an NHMRC-funded Centre for Research Excellence. I'm the Vice President of the Victorian Branch of the [Statistical Society of Australia](http://www.statsoc.org.au/). We hold seminars every month: see our [meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/Statistical-Society-of-Australia-Victorian-Branch/) for details of upcoming events. I was on the Local organising and Scientific Programme committees of the [2018 Joint International Society for Clinical Biostatistics and Australian Statistical Conference](http://iscbasc2018.com/), which took place in Melbourne from the 26-30 of August 2018.
